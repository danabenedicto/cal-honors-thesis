This research project overall aims to study the impact of a flexible extension policy on mastery-based learning. The hypothesis is that equitable grading practices and student-centered approaches through flexible extensions would yield several positive outcomes, including enhanced engagement, reduced stress levels, and better learning outcomes. This is because students can focus better on understanding the material, rather than trying to get it submitted on time and giving up once the deadline passes. 

This rationale behind this research project is to attempt to ‘lose’ less students—in a typical classroom experience, a student may find the coursework challenging and overwhelming, they may have other life circumstances that affect their ability to work, and/or office hours queues are absymal, so they are unable to complete the assignment due to lack of timely instructor support. In many classes, extension policies solely consist of strict deadlines with n drops; if a student realizes they cant finish an assignment in its entirety, they may use a drop or accept then 0 and never think about the assignment again-–this represents a missed learning experience. Thus, the objective is to study how an alternative perspective on assignments, through more flexible deadlines as opposed to strict assignment policies, may allow students to master concepts more thoroughly and yield higher learning gains.
